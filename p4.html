	 <h1> Health effects </h1> <hr>

	 <p>A 2017 review of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" target="_blank">clinical trials</a> found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily.</p>

	 <p> Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size. </p>
	 <ul>
	 <li><h2>Digestion </h2></li>

		<p> A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote gastrointestinal reflux.Two reviews of clinical studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption was safe and effective for enhancing postoperative gastrointestinal function.</p>

	<li><h2>Cardiovascular disease</h2></li>
	
		<p>Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease.A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day.</p>
		<p> A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is less likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day, but more likely with over five cups per day.</p>
	
	<li><h2>Mental health</h2></li>

		<p>The UK NHS advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety. Caffeine, the major active ingredient in coffee, is associated with anxiety.At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety.</p>

		<p> Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of substance- or medication-induced anxiety disorder. Populations that may be most impacted by caffeine consumption are adolescents and those already suffering anxiety disorders.Preliminary research indicated the possibility of a beneficial relationship between coffee intake and reduced depression. Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia and cognitive impairment, was inconclusive for coffee having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.</p>	

		<li><h2>Parkinson's disease</h2></li>
			<p>Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

		<li><h2>Type II diabetes</h2></li>
			<p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational studies, representing over one million participants, every additional cup of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated, respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

		<li><h2>Cancer</h2></li>
			<p>The research on the effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk generally indicate that it has no effect (gastric cancer), or produces a lower risk of cancer (carcinoma and lung cancer). A 2011 review found that regular coffee consumption of up to 6 cups per day reduced the risk of several types of cancer.</p>
